Description: raspi.lpd8806
        *************
        
        This package provides helpers to easily build fancy LED stuff with a "lpd8806
        based digital addressable RGB led strip":https://www.adafruit.com/products/306. 
        
        It consists of three parts.
        
        
        API for sequences
        =================
        
        To define a sequence you can use `raspi.lpd8806.led_lib.Sequence` as a base
        class.
        
        On the class you can set, if the sequence should loop by setting `loop =
        True`.
        
        You also have to define the used leds by the sequence on the class in a list
        `leds = [12, 33, 44]`.
        
        The actual sequence is defined in the __call__ method which has to
        return a generator yielding leds with their values for each frame.
        
        You can set a single Led via `raspi.lpd8806.led_lib.Led(index).on(red, green,
        blue)`, or set multiple Leds at once via `Leds([12, 33, 44]).on({12: (r, g, b),
        33: (r, g, b), 44: (r, g, b)})`.
        
        There is also a convenience method to set a predefined part of your strip by
        using `raspi.lpd8806.led_lib.Strip('strip_name').on(r, g, b)`.
        
        Led, Leds and Strip instances of course also have `off()` methods to set all
        colors to 0.
        
        
        Webserver
        =========
        
        The Webserver serves a page with buttons to start or stop the sequences.
        It is started with the led_webserver script. See --help for details.
        
        Queue Worker
        ============
        
        The Queue worker processes the commands of the webserver and communicates with
        the LED strip. It can be started with the led_queue_worker script. See --help
        for details.
